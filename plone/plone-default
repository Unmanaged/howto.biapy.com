# Plone default file
# -----------------
#
# This file controls the start and the stop of ZEO servers and ZOPE instances
# with the init script provided by Plone unified installer package.
#
# The following variables should contain a space sperated list of ZEO server
# and ZOPE instance names which you want to start with the init script.
# Note that ZEO servers will be started _before_ any instance, and that's
# your responsability to check dependencies between ZEO servers and ZOPE
# instances. The order of the variables doesn't matter.
#
# ZEO servers and ZOPE instances are searched in %INSTALL_PATH%.
#
# ALL means that you would like to start all servers/instances, NONE (or an 
# empty value) means, well, none.

# ZEO servers
ZEOSERVERS="ALL"

# ZOPE instances
INSTANCES="ALL"

# If you want to start client1 and client2 only :
#INSTANCES="client1 client2"
